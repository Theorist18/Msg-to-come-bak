    Hey 😊 I just wanted to say something 😩 no pressure👌no expectations🙏 just honesty from me😇<br><br>
    I’m really thankful we still talk like we used to ♥️ You’ve always made me feel like I matter 🥺 like I’m seen and understood 😳 That’s why I fell for you 🥰 You were my safe space or refuge 🤭<br><br>
    Back then 😞 I let go partly because I felt like I was the only one holding on 😓 But I see it more clearly now 💪 Your love has always been quiet 😚 like how you still try to chat with me when you’re free and rested 😋 even if college keeps you busy 😵<br><br>
    I understand now that you only want to talk when you're in the right state of mind 💖 And I understand that now 🙏 So I’m okay with it 😇 I’ve learned that love doesn’t always need to be expressive or intense—sometimes, it’s in the small effort 🤏 the thoughtful replies 😁 the care behind the silence 🙏<br><br>
    So if ever, one day, you feel ready to give “us” another try 😊 I’ll be here like I promised 🤗 But even if not, I’ll still care for you as your friend 🤝 and as someone who quietly holds you in a special place in his heart 🖤<br><br>
    So, if you ever feel like falling again 😅 I’ll catch you ☺️ just like I did when we were crossing that small river back in Grade 11 😁<br><br>
    Kaya bilisan mo na mag-graduate 🎓 para makapagligaw na 'ko 😆💐 jkjk XD
